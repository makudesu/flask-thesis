Chapter II. REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDIES
====================================================

The literature and studies cited in this chapter tackle the different concept, understanding, and ideas, generalization or conclusions and different development related to study of the enrollment from the past up to the present and which serves as the researchers guide in developing the project. Those that were also included in this chapter helps in familiarizing information that are relevant and similar to the present study.

Theoretical Background
----------------------

Enrollment management is “not just an organizational concept: it is both a process and a series of activities that involve the entire campus” ( Hossler & Bean, 1990).
Dennis (1998) defines enrollment management as forecasting trends that will affect higher education and utilizing research to plan for the future (Dennis,1998). Second, Dennis lists the following attributes of those who understand enrollment management. Hossler and Bean conclude that there are two goals of enrollment management. “First, to exert more control over the characteristics of the student body and two control the size of the student body” (& Bean, 1990, p.5)
Given these two perspectives, one would say that enrollment management is concerned with the attraction and retention of students (Braxton, Vesper, & Hossler, 1995). Donhardt (1995), feels that enrollment management involves the influence of the whole enrollment picture from recruitment through graduation. Bateman and Spruill (1995) found that enrollment management extends to the educational outcomes of attendance.
Hossler and Bean (1990) define enrollment management as “efforts to influence the characteristics and the size of enrolled student bodies by directing the activities of the offices of admissions, financial aid, new-student orientation, career planning, retention, and a number of other student affairs areas” (Dennis, 1998). Tinto and Russo (1994) report that the success of enrollment management programs has been only moderately successful.
In traditional way of enrolling, manual enrollment system is commonly used as a way of enrolling students to and is continuing to be used nowadays. In manual way of registering and enrolling students they must have to fill up first using ball pen and an enrollment form sheet given by their teachers. By the help of different developers and programmers, they have developed different system about the registration and enrollment process. Computerized, online registration and online enrollment systems that helps the school for having an easier process of managing student information.

    Based on the researcher, a web-based enrollment system for Veritas Parochial School (VPS) in Web Based enrollment system, Manila was developed to help its students enroll in a more efficient way without the hassles of waiting long hours in filling out forms, which sometimes become redundant, or to stand in line and pay at the cashier. It is with the Web-based Enrollment System for VPS that this new style of enrollment may be achieved. This new type of system offers its students new options for enrolling at VPS. By logging on to VPS website, one can register and enroll subjects for a school year. With these, all the students are required to fill out certain forms that do not take more than a few minutes to accomplish. The system stores its records in the school database for future references.
    Confirmation of the transaction made by the students need to be verified, the payment of tuition fees must be made in the schools registrar. The students may also browse the web site of VPS and he can check his current account. He can also refer to the list of the school current tuition fee rates (Pascual & Riceo, 2008)
    According to Lopez (2005), a registration system helps and provides efficient and reliable services to the students, enrollment personnel and administration. Moreover, this system improved the process of enrollment in terms of searching, retrieving and subject schedules. 
    While in a study conducted by Cayabyab (2007), many problems and difficulties were identified in the existing system of Dagupan City National High School (DCNHS). These major concerns are affecting the efficient enrollment system of students. Security of the students records were found to be at high risk. The current system may fail to protect some important documents. It has also untimely and inefficient report generation. A computerized system for DCNHS shall result to a significant increase in the number of enrollees
    Network-Based Enrollment system
    Conde (2007) in his study entitled “Network-bases Enrollment System of Paete National High School cited that the manual process of enrollment and manual handling of information and reports of the students is very laborious one. The proponents developed a network based system enrollment system to the said school to solve the huge amount of task. 
    Garcia (2002) created the “LSPC Enrollment System”, the study can be a great help to persons concerned during the enrollment period, the registrar, instructor of the students as they retrieval necessary information when needed and lessen the burden manually browsing over enrollment slip for record purposes Saayo et.al (2008) developed the system “Network based automated Enrollment and grading system for Morong National High School. Due to increasing population of the institution, and the school currently implementing the manual system, every student spends a lot of time during enrollment period, such as paying their tuition fees and processing the school requirements. Valina et.al (2009), in this work entitled “Network-based student Permanent Record keeping and Enrollment System of Balian National High School”. This System was made to lessen the time and effort exerted by both student and school employees. It is also made to give accurate reports and keep records of every students every students and for easy and fast way of enrollment.
    Soria (2006), constructed a system entitled “Network-based Computerized inventory System for the supply office o the LSPC main campus. With the advancement of technology, devices and machines were improve , developed and inverted to cope up with the need of new world. There are different systems designed for reliable, efficient and very useful to the user. Cabang et al. (2003) developed the ‘computerized Students Record Monitoring System of Siniloan National High School”, Computerized Student data will be exceedingly helped to the user through continuous management of the School. It could help the registrar for a less effort services in the institutions especially in updating, printing and deleting student’s record. 
    Velasco (2002) Study entitled “Maulawin National High School Student Information System” cited that maintaining students, records manually is a very difficult task and time consuming. In that case, computerization system that can help and handle 17 this data needed to speed up the process of student’s record keeping and to promote and reliability. 
    Cura et al. (2004), Designed system entitled “computerized inventory system of office of the supply in LSPU” is capable of handling voluminous data about the flow of item insurance and reply to the flow of items’ issuance and return in supply office Torres et al. (2002), conducted a study that resolves around the importance computerization of student information. This study was conducted with the hope that it would help minimize time and effort in processing student’s information in Maulawin National High School. The basic feature of this study is after the storage and access of retrieving and updating the data.
    Alcaira (1999), stated that the using of computer are continue to grow, the need for a more timely information and data processing comes on demand keeping the record of any manual operations need the application, because handling it manually will only be conflicting. Aravia et al. (2002), show the growing importance of computers in the society. The significance of the study revolves the automation of student permanent record keeping. Garnace (1999), developed application software for the computerized information system of a commercial piggery using the concept of the database and implemented it in database. 
    
    Automation Enrollment System
    Gumitao (2001), system is designed to provide reports of the list of enrollment per school year, periodical grade of students, and list of new, old and transferees Revalla (2005) created an Automation Enrollment System for the computer Science Department of the Laguna College business and Arts. The study was conceived because of the need to update the current registration system of LCBA, which is done manually. Her study, was based on the special problem of Mr. Bonifacio E. Bacani, Jr. about “Student Record information System”. 
    Kampitan (2000) developed an Enrollment System of Liceo De Victoria that is designed to keep the students records. This is used to provide an effective and faster of providing information of the student and also the accounting purposes’ Liceo De Victoria Enrollment was developed and implement using relational database and designed in clipper 5.3. Earlier, Encila (1999) Introduced the Enrollment System for the computer Science Department of LCBA and traders, designed of enrollment System is advantageous to the school because it speed up the process and with only a minimum amount of power and resources. 
    Cacao (2002), designed the “Morning Star Montessori School incorporated form 137implemented in Fox Base. Solomon (2002), developed Enrollment and Record keeping System, to know how to read sign the data that is used to be kept the record files of students and also that, it could be mange more efficiently in computer with his project. 
    Quiver (2001), developed a program using database III which capable of retrieving, access in manipulating of data in easy way. A computerized system to minimized the lost of record and burden of work was designed by Pajarillo in 2002. Monsalve and Ilagan (2005), developed a program and designed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Microsoft access. The system is capable of receiving access, searching items, providing adequate information and data gathering.
    IPizzara and Veridiano (2001), this system was done using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. This conducted system goes along the trend of computerization to be in the field of competitiveness and survive to the complicated works. Relayo (1999) this study will assist the researcher regarding to the use of database and Visual Basic. This system have been designed in order to speed up the access and retrieval information and to lessen manual effort involve in the library routine of transaction. Magalang (2003), he proposed this to developed software that will help the management of the school “lyceum’ in giving good service to its student in speeding of the process involve in monitoring account acquired during the enrollment & other payment transaction. Lazaro (2004), this study entitled “Liceo de Los Banos record monitoring system” password was created for the protection and was designed to be user-friendly by only authorized persons and to ensure security of data basic information. 
    Lumbers (2002), stated in her study entitled “a systematic enrollment process using database system in Saint John academy. Calamba, Laguna” that the application of database system to the enrollment process will greatly increase its efficiency; automation of enrollment process will upgrade the quality of the services provided for the qualified enrollees. 
    Online enrollment system
    An Online Registration System was proposed to replace the manual enrollment system of Cavite Maritime Institute in order to advance an organized flow of transaction and an ease of work concerned on how the manual enrollment performs throughout the institution’s operations. The numerous transactions that the manual system covers, such as updating and adding student records, generating the advising and assessment slips, and the like considering the manual operating system to be inefficient for the need of the institution. Since the study involves proper record handling, tracing the constraints and evaluation of the manual system is essential (Bacala and Reano, 2009).
    In educational institutions like Harvent School in Dagupan City, Composed of elementary and high school level. The school puts premium to its registration. The enrollment process is the initial stage in gathering bonafide fide and accurate student information necessary to establish student permanent records. A registration and billing system is needed by the institution to address the stated situation. The study has been made to help Harvent School gather fast and deliver accurate information (Calabozo & Fernandez, 2006)
    Online enrollment system is utilized today by many universities to facilitate the enrollment of their students into classes every semester (Gaton, 2012). The system allows students to choose courses they want to take with the available class schedules. This allows students to make up their time schedules for different class courses without time schedule conflicts. After the allotted enrollment period, the system runs and assigns slots to students.
    With the Online Registration System, students could log in, check their schedule, and set desired changes and pay online without having to stand in a line and rushing to meet deadlines to accomplish all the transactions required for enrollment (Ella, 2012). 
    The Online Registration System is a method designed to perform the process involved in registration, advising, assessments, and payments of students as well as scheduling of classes in any educational institution.
    According to Aquino (2005), importance of computer application is increasing day by day. In the latest decades of the millennium winning organizations are those which are willing to integrate business strategy and information technology in plying their respective trades. The use of information technology results for them to be able to develop products fast and make decisions fast, ability to have fluid organization structures, able to cope with the demanding work force and external environment by the rapid development of innovative approaches, and lastly, using information system confirms the company’s vision and mission. Schools use information systems in the way of implementing an enrollment system. This results for them to attract enrollees and earn an income. Enrollees are attracted because the use of the said system makes the transactions faster and easier.
    Alcuaz (1988) stated that the use of computer can give competitive advantage and improve profitability. Computer helps to increase the productivity of people. This is true whether they are working alone or working with others within a formal organization such as business corporations. 
    As said by Adrian(2011), “Lack of enrollment system in schools can lead to chaos and troubles.” Students will be confused on what they should do to be able to enroll that is why such systems is extremely useful in the way that it gives an ease on working on enrollment processes. Enrollment is very useful in retrieving vital information of the students. Without it can lead difficulty both for the administration of school and student in enrollment processes 
    Many countries today, especially the developing nations are challenged by the rapid technological changes. This has radically changed the living and working styles of the entire society. This transformation has been driven partly by rapid technological innovation. While in the 20th century, people saw the rise of the industrial revolution with steam-powered machines intensifying and expanding human productive power, the 21st century was characterized by the birth of machine-powered flight and the emergence of broadcasting and computer technologies that extend the reach of human creativity even more and made new ways possible by which humans could live and work together (Tinio, 2002). 
    The transformation of manual enrollment transaction to automate and now into a web-based automation is one example of what was driven partly by the rapid technological innovation. Any ways just to make work easier and faster like enrollment transactions is possible with the emergence of computer technologies. 
    Technology innovation had influenced man’s work from data processing, business transaction, research, planning, monitoring and even in medical operation on human anatomy are now entrusted to computer technology. Web applications are popular due to ubiquity of its applications. The ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on potentially thousands of client computers are key reasons for its popularity. A significant advantage of building web applications to support a standard browser feature is the ability to perform as specified, regardless of the operating system installed on a given client (Bacala &Reanno, 2009). 
    Web-based enrollment system
    A web-based enrollment system has features that meet most of academic institutions system’s needs and requirements. This includes standardized modules for student registration, enrollment, grade management, and other modules that are deemed necessary to operate a school. 
    Based on the researcher, a web-based enrollment system for Veritas Parochial School (VPS) in Web Based enrollment system, Manila was developed to help its students enroll in a more efficient way without the hassles of waiting long hours in filling out forms, which sometimes become redundant, or to stand in line and pay at the cashier.

    Confirmation of the transaction made by the students need to be verified, the payment of tuition fees must be made in the schools registrar. The students may also browse the web site of VPS and he can check his current account. He can also refer to the list of the school current tuition fee rates (Pascual & Riceo, 2008)

This study was conducted with the hope that it would help minimize time and effort in processing student’s information in Maulawin National High School. The basic feature of this study is after the storage and access of retrieving and updating the data.
    According to Jennifer Rowley (2005), information systems are a tool to support information management. Information systems are increasingly being used in organizations with the objective of providing competitive advantage. The information systems used by organizations can be grouped into different types such as transaction processing system, management information system, decision support system, executive information system, expert systems and office information system. Information Technology has heralded the advent of the information society. The information society may be a “virtual society”. The concepts of the electronic classroom, the electronic office and electronic library have been explored. Information system poses a number of issues on society in general, including: changing employment patterns, archiving, and bibliographic control, security and data protection, intellectual property, marketplace issues and access. 
    An registration system is basically included in one of the classification of information system that is stated by the author, thus it serves as a tool to support information management with regards to the student data, enrollment fees information and other with a connection to the enrollment process. Every school gain competitive advantage of having this system for they will have the capacity on handling important information at ease and with security. The iterative implementation approach is a theory that eliminates problems of using a waterfall study. This is invented to avoid a linear and sequential development of study. The overall functionality of the system is broken down into feature sets. These features sets often based upon use cases from the analysis stage, containing group of individual features that are related, typically by a functional area (Stephen McHenry, 2010) 
    Adopting the theory of Stephen McHenry which is known as the iterative implementation covers the breakdown of overall functionality of the system to a what he called feature set and those feature sets represents different process involve in an enrollment system. It helps locate what feature an enrollment system will have since that this kind of systems does many activities and processes. 
    As said by Dunn and Scott (2005), science and technology is the root of emerging innovations in this world. For many years now, a person in this field of expertise does not stop to reshape the landscape of today’s business world. Enrollment system has made huge impact into the school arena. It is a system that is built on innovative program strategies. It is a system that will help both the enrollment personnel-in-charge and the students to easily process the enrollment at a lesser time. Distinct from traditional enrollment, LAN enrollment system process large assortment of student records and provides efficient and consistent information services. 
    As stated by Holmes (2006), “The Internet is neither an extraordinary communication tool nor revolutionary. It simply represents the current stage in the development of human capabilities through written language, which itself derived from the spoken form.” That statement only shows that advancement in modern technology is at their highest peak. Nowadays, Web-based applications are widely used due to their ubiquity. 
    Web-based enrollment system is currently emerging on markets for they are offering transaction convenience and service efficiency through the use of Internet. This system becomes a powerful tool in dealing with information management regarding enrollment transactions. According to Forman (2007), continuing innovation in technologies can lead to organizational changes that range from improvement of day to day operation and for easy access it provides for the end users. Many schools today have adapted this innovation in offering of their services which is parallel with the concept of Tinn (2001), stated that the computerization responded to the call the office or any workplace to help their daily operation. Malolos et.al (2002) stated that the study of automation is important in the sense time it minimizes the time and effort normally exerted in manual process. While Janes (2001) stated that computers are extremely reliable device and very powerful calculators with some great accessories applications like word processing problem for all of business activities, regardless of size, computers have three advantages over other type of office equipment that process information because computer are faster, more accurate more economical. Reyes (2005) task would be time consuming to accomplish manually and more practical with the aid of computers field in cabinet. 
    According to Flores (2002), the automation is described simply as the substitution of machine control of human. Dioso (2001) stated that computer assist careful intelligent planning, organizing, actuating and controlling .This maybe observed from the past that they monitor production activities, solve scientific problem and help arrive in tentative answer to a multitude of involved conditions. Ralph M. Stair (1999) emphasized that the development of technology through the years have enabled us to do more with less effort. From the orientation of the light bulb to the industrial revolution and beyond, we have continuously tried to in a more efficient means of doing tasks. Lewis (2002) stated that the reason for using computers vary from person to person. Some of the computers in business are to perform accuracy, to be as productivity, to decrease bottle necks or hassles to alter cash flows or to simplify elevate your status. Gold Chager et al (2003) said that computer as a device for processing information knew computer plays a significant role in their lives, but few are aware of just how pervasive role is. Mane (2000) mentioned that the creation of the computer made the easier to accomplish task than by doing it manually, to have the direct access on straightforward answer just monitoring record where in the needs of computer make possible for everyone to get data in a particular need. We can consider that the computer is necessary and it is a productive tool for individual. Gurewich (1999) stated that the database system makes the work faster for every institution. For the mere fact that instead of doing things manually, with the use of computer technology everything is done faster.
    Computer- Based Enrollment system
    Halili, M.C.N. (2004) that man’s actions are just involuntary movements especially when time allow to plan his next action. These responses pass through the process of reasoning and analysis. Huntchinson et.al (2001) stated that file is a collection of related records. Examples are the entire student’s courses card for Anthropology 101 or the transcript of all courses in the register’s office. Bryan (2006) emphasized the information system is a set of people, procedures and resources that collects, transforms and disseminates information in an organization to do’s ends rely on many types of information system (IS). They might include simple manual information system and informal system and also computer based information system that uses hardware, software telecommunication and other forms of information technology (IT). Sander (2002) computers are an intelligence amplifier that can free human to use their time effectively. 
    Because a computer is a fast and accurate electronic symbol or data manipulating system that design automatically accept and store input data process and procedure output results under the direction of the stored program or instruction. Tows and (2005), stated that database is instructed collection of data. The data may be about people, product events in short, any type of information is to manage the collection of data for reporting and making decision. Adamski (2007), give some advantages of database processing first economy of scale getting more information from some amount of data, sharing data balancing conflicting requirement, enforcement of standard, controlled redundancy consisting integrity security ,flexibility and responsiveness ,increase programmers productivity, improve program maintenance and data independence Perkins (1999) stated that computer has an impressive impact upon business, governmental organization; bank and all sorts of organization and on how they are operate and manage. Alcaria (2004) explained that the use of computer are continue to grow, the need for a more timely information and data processing comes on demand keeping the records of any manual operations need the application of computer because handling it manually will only be conflicting. Kroenke (2002) in the early 1970’s database processing was considered an esoteric subject of interest only to the longest corporation with the largest computer. 
    Information system-Database System Concept
    Today, database processing is becoming an information system standard. Silberschatz (2006) in his book “” the goal of database system is to simplify and facilitate access to data.In relation to Ahitud et.al (2007) mentioned that information system are more collection of hardware, software and people. They should be constructed to fit the organization’s strategy and structure so that it could easily be adapted to the information they needed. Asumbra (2002) Access to information is the best way to. In line with technology access to information within fingertips is the easier way to be equipped in the future. While Hammer (2003), said that computer could eliminate the need for copying and rearranging information, which was entered into system. They also perform mathematical computation; in short computer can eliminate most of the paper works. Microsoft Corporation (2002), explained that computer network are collection of computer and intelligent peripheral equipment that are inter connected by telephone lines, micro wave relays and other high-speed communication links of the purpose of exchanging data and sharing equipment. 
    Cognos-based enrollment management system
    Southern California Community College Long Beach City College has gone live with a Cognos-based enrollment management system that was designed by Irvine, CA-based professional services firm e2e Analytic. Prior to installing the new system, LBCC, which has two main campuses and multiple satellites that support nine schools and 34 departments, handled its enrollment via manual spread sheets. With no reporting, continuity, or standard practices, and with lengthy error corrections, the school's enrollment management budgeting and planning took up to three months to compile, consolidate, and implement (Koft 2007)
    The study on problems regarding on school such as the Long Beach City College is an aid for the proponents to have the idea on formulating solutions on transferring manual enrollment transactions to an automated or computerized one.
    According to the coordinator of Admission Support of Kerian Greenaway, the system known as the Edith Cowan University Web Enrollment System (ECUWES) had replaced the traditional hard copy system of enrollment. The system offers immediacy and convenience of course enrollment via the internet. The said university in Australia is currently enrolling more than 5,000 new students with easier transactions cause of their online enrollment system. In the local setting, academic institutions both the private and government schools are shifting from manual to computerized system including student registration. This is accomplished either on an intranet or internet-based environment. 
    The desire to overcome these problems and difficulties has led the acceptance of advanced technology. It includes Local Area Network of computers, CD ROM and powerful processor. These technologies led to the development of information databases that provides simple and prompt retrieval of information through networking, In Local Area Network Enrollment System (LANES), the problems on admission and evaluation of academic records, subject reservation, assessment and payment of fees and issuance of class cards are besieged. Likewise, searching of records is effective due to its major key that is being used in retrieval of records. 
    A Local Area Network Enrollment System (LANES) is a broad system. It is a combination of different function areas such as databases, searching, retrieval, and update of student records, checking of students’ schedule, computation of fees. (Dzubeck, Frank, 2003)
    Inspired by the advancement of modern technology and the problems regarding enrollment transactions the proponents have come up with an online enrollment system exclusively for school with many enrollees. Several factors are considered in designing the proposed system. First is the tedious task of filling out application forms and inaccuracies of information provided by the students that cause delay on the enrollment process. Other is that were problems on giving and announcing schedules of enrollees and cause for them to be late at their very first class. 
    The researchers gathered data necessary in the enrollment system for the success of the study in providing benefit for the employees and students so they can have access and have the ability to manage information directly and conveniently.
    A software development and IT service firm implemented its catalyst in Governor Andres Pascual College was integrated web platform to provide content management, transaction processing, marketing, and interactive community function to the two rice schools. Catalyst deliver on the Jones school’s two primary criteria for selecting a web-based platform: simplifying content management; and enabling user response to information such as event RSVP and course registration. The content management tools lets the Jones school staff edit, update or add to the volume of curriculum and event information without calling for technical assistance. They simply cut and paste document into the content management system audit for consistency and publish to the web. The school’s diverse audiences, which include MBA’s executive Mb As, executive education participants, and alumni, now receives prompt notification of news and events, and can RSVP for event or register online for Executive Education courses.

Synthesis

Similarities
++++++++++++

    With the above mention studies, Enrollment system of Veritas Parochial School used web-based and databases to stores their records. Students will logging on website, register and fill out certain forms. Liceo De Victoria Enrollment was developed and implements using relational databases. As for Quiver (2001), who also developed a program using database III which capable of retrieving, access in manipulating of data in easy way. The study of Lumber (2002), which is all about the systematic enrollment process using database in Saint John Academy, helps enrollment process increase its efficiency.
    Bacala & Reanno (2009), in their study that tells the significant advantage of building web applications to support a standard browser feature is the ability to perform as specified. With Stephen McHenry (2010),using WAMP(Windows Apache MySQL PHP is used to develop dynamic web sites with apache server, PHP5 script languages and database of MYSQL release 5.
    The studies support the use of applications using the web so that students can access the websites. The researchers used a database to increase the efficiency of registration procedures. They also used it for purposes such as storing records or information of students and access in manipulating data in an easy way. Using WAMP server and PHP languages is one way for them to develop their system.

Differences
+++++++++++

    According to Ella (2012), the ideas and concept where the students will check their schedule, view subjects and teachers and set desired changes and  pay online. While Gaton (2012), the system allows students to choose courses they want to take with the available class schedules. This allows students to make up their time schedules for different class courses without time schedule conflicts. After the allotted enrollment period, the system runs and assigns slots to students.
    Both concept and ideas does not cover the researchers system in terms of online payments or computation of student’s grades, class scheduling, and assessment of fees.
