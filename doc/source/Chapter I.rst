Chapter I. THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND
=========================================

    Today, computers and the Internet, has become an important element in the life of people around the world.

    The young generation use those technological advances at incredibly faster and more successful rate than the previous generations. One of the main reasons, is that they were born in the present world where the world's most vast information library is available for free anywhere any time. We call it the internet. The internet is not just the web.
   
    According to Wikipedia:

    *The Internet is the global system of interconnected mainframe, personal, and wireless computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide. It is a network of computers that consist of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.*


    From Wikipedia:

    *The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, Usenet newsgroups, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file-sharing.*

    The web is just a part of the internet, email is just a part of the internet, p2p networks is just a part of the internet, cloud computing, etc.

    Now let's discuss cloud computing.

    Another from Wikipedia:

    *Cloud computing, also on-demand computing, is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.*

    Basically it’s a shared Infrastructure/Application/Platform slash resources.

    Another from Wikipedia:

    *Moore's law (/mɔərz.ˈlɔː/) is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.*

    And computers as we know is composed of millions if not billions of transistor. Which affects the performance and the price.
    
    We now have free Internet :ref:`[1]`, and computers get cheaper :ref:`[2]`. 


    The Internet in the Philippines has been undergoing development since it was first made available in 1994. As of September 30, 2011, more than 30,000,000 people used the internet in the country accounting for 33% of the total population.

    The problem is, public schools are still using the old, manual way of enrollment that takes days, weeks or even months to finish. With the help of free Internet and cheaper computers, we decided to develop a system that will aid the BNHS public school (our choice) to transition into a more advance computerized enrollment system hosted on cloud.

Introduction
------------

As technology continues to advance, computers becomes a closer to everyday life Computers are already seen everywhere at work, at school, and at home. Daily activities either involve the use of or depend on information from a computer. This maybe because computers are used in almost every field and profession like education and office works to perform large number of computer related work. Computerization is a control system that manages processes in industrial workplace. It reduces human errors and processing time, thus it can boost productivity that results into high quality of product. In information system, computerization is concerned about interrelating different but interdependent transactions. This can result in a system with well-integrated processes that can perform much faster and more accurate than the manual system. This can result in a system with well-integrated processes that can perform much faster and more accurate than a manual system.
In the field of education, researchers and theorists have focused intensively in recent years on examining the concepts and use of information in to assist administrators, teachers, students and parents. Schools, like any other organization used to manage all sorts of data and information to ensure attainment of its goals and objectives. The emerging needs in most schools for accurate and relevant data and reliable information strengthen the student information.
According to Forman (2007), in his article “New Research Perspectives on Mobility, Organizations, Systems and Technologies,” continuing innovation in technologies can lead to organizational changes that range from improvement of day-to-day operation and for easy access it provides for the end users. Many schools today have adapted this innovation in the offering of their services. 
Online registration system allow students to register through the internet, eliminating or reducing problems with traditional registration systems, such as long lines, paper forms and troublesome wait lists
Online registration system is very essential in a school. Just like in the case of Bambang National High School where to utilize the use of a manual. The school used manual system in recording and retrieving student’s information. On the other hand, registrar’s office also used manual system as a way of recording and retrieving student information. Above the researcher’s observation, human interventions will highly involve in this type of system. As a result, this may involve errors and duplication of data resulting troubles in organization.
Inspired by the online registration services, the researchers came up with an online enrollment system for the Bambang National high schools. The school has adapting the K to 12 which means that the 1st year, 2nd year, third year and fourth year are now called as Grade 7, Grade 8, Grade 9, Grade 10 and Grade 11 and Grade 12 is known as senior high School. The study considered the prevailing process of the school and this process can be modified to have a more efficient and effective enrollment system. One of the factors considered in designing the proposed system is the lack of manpower to accommodate all enrollees. The tedious task of filling out the application form and the inaccuracies of information provided by the students are also considered. These factors cause enrollment delays, which is disadvantageous to the enrollment personnel and the enrollees. Since the study involves proper records handling, tracing the constraints and evaluation of the manual system is essential. Thus, the researchers gathered data necessary in the enrollment system, which is designed to benefit the schools, teachers, and students and especially school administrators and faculties as well because they can access and manage information directly and conveniently.

Objectives of the Project
-------------------------

General Objectives
++++++++++++++++++

The main objective of the study is to develop an online registration system of Bambang National High School.

Specific Objectives
+++++++++++++++++++

* To create an online registration for enrollees of Bambang National High School.
* To develop an accurate and easier way of registration for the students of Bambang National High School.
* To Generate reports needed for enrollment
* To provide a user friendly enrollment website in managing enrollment of old students, new student and transferees.

Scope and Limitations
---------------------

Scope
+++++

The Online registration system is a portal type that covers the major processes in the registration system, namely registration and enrollment of students and file maintenance such as list of enrolled students in different year levels in public high schools. 
    Administrators have total access to the system, view students records that are officially enrolled and generate or print records of the students, search student profile information and viewing subjects of each level of any grade.

Limitations
+++++++++++

The system does not cover the computation of student’s grades, class scheduling, viewing of teachers and paying of fees. Not accepting any online payments. It can only operate for high school enrollment purposes. It can’t show the schedule of time of the subjects per year level.

Significance of the Project
---------------------------

The significance of the study would justify the need to conduct the study. It specifies the group of people who will benefit from the study.
Students. The study will help students to be knowledgeable enough on entering the information technology fields as applying the lectures to actual performances and to inform them of an easy way of registration. It will give them also a background and become more advance and be familiar on having a new way of registration.
Faculty. In this proposed system, it will help them to lessen their work and less time consumed in handling the enrollment process for the students. It helps them to minimize the effort and time exert in terms of gathering the data or information of the students.
Administrators. The result of this investigation would serve as a benchmark for them to make an easy on handling the student records during the enrollment. It will help to lessen their work and help them also to have a fast way of enrolling students as well as in securing student information.
Future Researchers. This study would serve as a handy reference for the other researchers who would embark on a similar study in the future especially on certain aspects not derived into by the present study.
